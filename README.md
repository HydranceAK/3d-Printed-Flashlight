Hello, I hope you find my 3d printed flashlight project useful. Please do not share or upload anywhere without giving me credit.
If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me on gmail, hydranceyt@gmail.com, or discord, .hydrance.

**WARNING**
The LEDS produce high amounts of light that could quickly cause extreme harm to your eyes if looked at for a few seconds.
Extreme heat is also produced, please do NOT use LED's other than for a few seconds for testing UNLESS they are attached to the heatsink with cooling.
PLEASE USE WITH CARE
